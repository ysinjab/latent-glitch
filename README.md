# latent-glitch

Spatial AI Ecologies explores creative AI in a collaborative fashion to produce a new cognition of interiority. Rooted in the material basis of intelligence, and how geology, biology and technology interact, the work utilizes ai algorithms to construct a new intriority; an amalgam of media created using AI.

The following algorithms have been used:
* **3D GAN**: Following this paper we built a GAN model that generates AI 3D meshes. Check [michleangelo](latent-glitch/tree/master/michleangelo)


## Michleangelo

## Music part

chec jukebox.ipynb


## Text to image
text_to_image_dalle_ipynb.ipynb has the implementation where we used DALL-E to generate images from text.


## Predict 3D objects from 2D images

MeshRCNN.ipynb includes using Mesh-RCNN algorithm to predict 3D meshes from 2D image. The output is .obj files


## PIF


## VQGAN+CLIP
We used VQGAN+CLIP to generate
